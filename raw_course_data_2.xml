Students would be introduced to the conditions, beginning in 19th century colonial rule in India, which led to the emergent Indian middle-class intelligentsia to experiment with European forms of literature but striving for an alternative expression. Indian languages became the medium through which writers sought to address issues of identity, tradition, modernity, gender, the rural and the urban, the private and the public. The course will study the various experiments in narration, language, characterization and style undertaken by authors to shape these themes.</description>

  <description>Pre–requisites: NLN101
The course involves a detailed study of 3-4 texts corresponding to the distinct phases of literary activity in the genre: the early period of the 1940s and 50s in which writers like Mulk Raj Anand, Raja Rao and R.K. Narayan made their presence felt, before Salman Rushdie, and more quietly, Amitav Ghosh and Vikram Seth, erupted into the scene in the 1980s, spawning a generation of writers attaining international acclaim - Arundhati Roy, Aravind Adiga, Kiran Desai, and many others. Some of the questions that will be addressed are: Who constitutes the main audience for this writing, and (how) does the writing cater to it? How does one position the expatriate Indian writer both residing and publishing abroad? How does English become an Indian language? Is there a thematic congruence in the novels that fall under this category, and does it differ from the thematic concerns of novels written in other Indian languages? Students will be encouraged to read a novel in at least one other Indian language in order to allow them to pose these questions in a more pointed manner.</description>

  <description>Pre–requisites: NLN101
This course offers a wide-ranging introduction to, and analysis of, varieties of spoken and written language. From political oratory to examination answer scripts to computer codes, not to mention jokes, riddles and poetry, human language offers an amazingly rich set of structures for expressing and conveying our thoughts, intentions and desires. The course will consider some of these linguistic structures and communicative strategies in detail, beginning with early childhood development. How is it that children in every culture learn language so effortlessly despite its great complexity? The course aims to introduce students to a set of theories that address this and other puzzles and mysteries in the arena of language studies. Finally, since a central focus of the course is communication, it will strive to be as interactive as possible, with lots of scope for the discussion and working out of actual ‘problems’ in language use.</description>

This course will begin with a discussion on the various constructions of Indian society from colonial to contemporary times. The structural and cultural dimensions of Indian society are explored at the level of village, city, region, nation and civilization. Sources of differentiation, diversity and unity are explored through institutions such as caste, class and tribe; kinship, family, marriage and gender systems, religious traditions and political organisations. Transformations in these institutions are analysed and fault lines explored by studying contemporary issues of secularism, communalism, religious conversions, caste and identity movements. The sociological perspective remains key to interpreting changes in Indian society in the era of globalization and rapid economic change.</description>

The course will involve a detailed study of 3-4 texts and their corresponding adaptations into film. By means of close reading, analysis, and discussion, it will seek to identify the changes that take place during the process of adapting one art-form into another and ask why those modifications occur. An evaluation of what each art-form enables and what it restricts or denies will enable a better understanding of form per se, and of these two forms in particular. Further, the course will address the question of genre and its conventions especially with regard to film, and observe the extent to which generic expectations shape the process of adaptation of text into film.

This course will study the various aspects of Indian theatre. The linkages between ancient theatre forms and existing forms of indigenous performance in various parts of India – such as the nautanki, the tamasha and the jatra. The energies which were generated in the urban centres through the encounter with European drama – the Parsi theatre, the nascent Marathi stage, the Hindi theatre of Bhartendu Harishchandra and the nationalist theatre of Calcutta – will be explored. Special attention would be paid to the transformation of theatre values with the intervention of the Indian People’s Theatre Association (IPTA). The focus for the post-Independence period would be on the diverse energies of urban theatre, group theatre and the ‘back to the roots’ movement.

The course will begin by seeking to distinguish the notion of ‘creative’ writing. It will contrast this heterogeneous category with other kinds of writing such as the ‘functional’ writing found in text-books and reportage. Through an analysis of various techniques of writing - in master-texts as well as students’ own productions - the course will explore why and how literary texts continue to be a prime source of emotional and intellectual stimulation across cultures. As far as possible, the course will focus on contemporary writing, given that writers write in the ‘here and now’ even as they imagine the future or return to past memories. Selected readings will be used to focus students’ attention on that most difficult of problems: to acquire a style of writing that makes a writer’s ‘voice’ both unique and universal. Finally, students will be required to write in some genre(s) of their choice. These genres will include the classic areas of poetry, fiction and play-writing but will neither exclude non-fiction genres like the essay and biography nor forms of writing thrown up by the ‘new media’ such as blogs, photo-essays and narrative-writing for story- boards and video-games.</description>

Satire is a classical genre that has thrived over the centuries in almost
all languages and cultures, and is found in a range of media. Life, in all aspects, everyday provides grist to the mill of satire, but does satire change anything? How do we define satire? Why is it considered the social genre? What are the contemporary forms of satire? Who can practice satire? It draws upon diverse techniques such as allegory, irony, caricature and laughter. Through analyses of examples, this course will familiarize students with satirical sub-genres and related literary practices, such as parody, burlesque, black humour, the grotesque, coarse humour, high and low comedy. It will examine the structure of satire, its relation with community, democracy and matters of gender, caste race, and religion.</description>

Is there a singular Indian tradition or is there a plurality of Indian traditions in the public sphere today? How do these find representation in the modern and textual frameworks? Is modernity antithetical to tradition?
The aim of this course is to take up these varied questions along with their nuances to understand and re-negotiate Indian intellectual traditions.
In this course, the examination of sources, structure, texts and exemplars from Indian intellectual tradition provide a theoretical framework for the discussion of contemporary political and social issues. Economic development, social justice, religion and the nation, communalism and secularism, caste, class and gender equality are themes to be addressed. The political misuse of tradition in programs of reform and revival both in the past and in modern times will be highlighted to underline the need for rethinking Indian Philosophy and intellectual tradition in an academically rigorous manner.

The course is a critical study of the problem of the self taken to be a substance by some and denied to have any substantial reality by others. Focus will be given on examining the worldview from which stems the idea of a continuing self, as a subject of consciousness and agent of action. Questions about whether it is material or immaterial, real or nominal object will centre the ontological investigation into the nature of the self. Special consideration will be given to the issue of self-awareness and self-reference, and its relation to the linguistic phenomenon of the first-person pronoun ‘I’.</description>

The manner in which gender is conceptualized and performed is foundational to the understanding of human social relationships. Gender identities are not fixed or determined purely by physiology; their social construction affects ideas of masculinity and femininity or other sexual identities. Besides understanding how sex and gender are interrelated, we will look at how gender intertwines with societal areas of economy, technology, polity, religion and demography. The important role played by social structures and institutions such as caste, kinship, family, marriage, ethnicity, religion and class in structuring gender and vice-versa will be brought out.
Technologies associated with population and biological sciences have transformed and are continuing to transform society and human relationships in particular directions. The course will examine these transformations at the global and local levels and consider their impact on individual lives. Challenges posed to intimate human relationships and identities by new reproductive technologies such as invitro-fertilization, surrogacy, sex selection will be explored. What does the emergence/ institutionalization of new social forms - such as same sex marriages and parenthood by surrogacy - tell us about the possibilities and limits of human relationships?</description>

Exploratory in nature, the course seeks to debate questions such as: What are the implications of conceiving the mind as a ‘machine’? Can evolutionary theories about language and tool-using help us understand how we continually manage today to process the world around us ‘online’? On this course, the class will be introduced to some state-of-the-art discussions in the interdisciplinary field of cognitive studies. These topics will include: (i) the modularity of mind (ii) the content of consciousness, (iii) the language bio-programme hypothesis, (iv) the relativism versus universals of controversy; (v) strong and weak positions on AI, etc. The course will rely on down- to-earth examples to demonstrate that such an interconnected area of study is not remote or esoteric but part of the intellectual excitement of living in the new millennium and attempting to anticipate both how it will shape us and how we will shape it.</description>

There is more to romanticism than Wordsworth’s poetry, or even literature in general. Nor is it confined between 1780s and 1830s. Least is it a trend succeeded by Victorianism and realism, and assailed by modernism. Romanticism contends with the question of presentation – of representation of and to oneself. It therefore directly participates in the philosophical discussions of reason, sensibility, emotion, subjectivity, and most importantly the idea of human freedom. This course will familiarize students with romantic movements in arts, in theories of language and society, in post- Kantian philosophy, in attitudes tor religion. Romantics not only engaged in experimental social practices and literary collaborations, but also articulated their necessity for the first time. Can we say that romanticism is at an end? How does it contribute to both a nationalism rooted in folk tradition, and individualism expressed in the cult of the hero, the solitary intellectual? How does it both look back to medieval occult and forward to novelties of science? Why is romanticism fascinated with animals, monsters and machines alike?</description>

  <description>This course is a Re-writing course rather than a writing course. While the act of writing is about what-to-write, the act of re-writing is about how-to-write. Logically, just as re-writing cannot precede writing, decisions on how-to-write cannot precede what-to-write. The issue is that by truncating or entirely omitting the step of re- writing, we end up with a write-up where the author did not take any authorial decisions regarding how-to-write. If the act of writing involves expressing one's ideas and reporting one's results, then the act of re-writing entails reading and organizing ideas, discovering and highlighting implications, editing the language and eventually evaluating one's work from the perspective of a reader.</description>

  <description>The course will introduce the key concepts and techniques in qualitative, experimental and computational paradigms. In the qualitative approach, focus will be on meaning making rather than information processing in the study of mind. Philosophical foundations of qualitative paradigm will be introduced. We will highlight how it complements rather than contradicts with experimental and/or computational approaches to research. In the experimental approach, the student will be taught how to design his/her own experiment independently. The student will be made aware of the key concerns that must be kept in mind while conducting an experiment, and how one can translate a research hypothesis to testable experiments that can be relied upon.
Finally, in the module on the computational approach, we will expose students to computational data analysis and machine learning
techniques deployed for data-driven research, and how the outputs of such techniques can be assessed and interpreted.
In all the modules, the students will learn how to frame a r esearch question in order to address an important issue related to cognitive science.</description>

  <description>The course will address three sorts of questions. The first set involves the status of science as a privileged source of knowledge: what, if anything, justifies this status? The second set involves concepts such as 'law' , 'cause', and 'explanation' which occur within scientific practice: how are these to be understood? The third set involves understanding the relationship between different scientific enterprises: is there a hierarchy of sciences ranging from physics at one end to the human or social sciences at the other? If so, how should this hierarchy be understood?</description>

A critical reading of ethnographic studies on the city provides a cross-cultural perspective on how space becomes culturally meaningful. The rise of the urban centre and metropolis are the product of a certain historical moment, yet they also produce distinctive mentalities and cultures that are unique to them.
The course will explore the structuring and contestation of urban space through categories of class, ethnicity, status and gender and study the city as the location of discourses of and struggles for citizenship.</description>

The course will comprise of 3 broad themes. In the 1st part of the course, we will introduce some advanced topics/packages in R. In the 2nd part, we will show how to use linear mixed-effect models from the perspective of frequentist statistics. The 3rd section will introduce the basics of Bayesian statistics and show how to fit hierarchical models from a bayesian perspective for data such as comprehension accuracy, reaction times, ratings, etc.</description>

  <description>The course examines in some detail the nature of the challenge that traditionally preoccupied European writers - how to map the experience of the modern city, and what representational strategies were adequate for capturing the opacity, the fragmentation, and the transitory nature of urban modernity. It goes on to investigate the contemporary postcolonial city in order to understand it in relation to late capitalism, globalization, migration, and postmodern culture, and the challenges these pose to classic modernity. It begins by providing an introduction to some of the most important literature on the city and the major theoretical debates around it, offering students a set of conceptual tools with which to approach the city’s incommensurable realities, its problems and its potential. It moves on to a detailed analysis of a number of literary texts, examining some of the ways in which the disjunctive realities of city-life shape new modes of experience, creative expression, and solidarity, without losing sight of the inequities of gender, culture, class, and race that persist and indeed strengthen in the current global economic system.</description>

  <description>This course explores the connection between sounds and words. While the correlation between the meaning and sounds of a word are arbitrary, the string of sounds or phonological shape of words and other morphological units follow certain universal well-formedness principles. While many of these principles derive from the manner in which individual languages form rhythmic/ prosodic domains in speech, some make crucial reference to morphological notions such as homonymy and synonymy. The aim of the course is to impart certain theoretical tools to analyze words from any natural language data. Since the objective of the course is to learn to analyze natural language data, it involves a substantial practical component.</description>

  <description>Traditionally studied by political scientists, the state has increasingly come to be regarded as an object of anthropological study. Ethnographic perspectives on the state seek to open up the state to critical scrutiny, dislodging it as a monolithic conceptual or territorial apparatus. These studies allow us to think of the state beyond governmentality or bureaucracy, to engaging with the multiple ways in which state ‘effects’ shape our engagement with it. How does the ‘idea’ of the state constrain the way in which we ‘think’ the state? What are the ethnographic sites through which the state emerges as an object of study, e.g., bureaucracy, law, sexuality, marriage, citizenship, borders etc? The course will consist of seminars designed around a set of readings, which will be discussed in detail each week.</description>

  <description>Sexual governance or state surveillance of issues pertaining to sexuality, marriage and mobility highlight the problematic division between the ‘public’ and the ‘private’. The ‘intimate’ sphere is no longer one that is outside the purview of states; indeed the ‘private’ or the ‘intimate’ is often co-produced as a corollary of the public face of a state’s legitimacy. Nationalism and patriotism are heavily grounded in issues pertaining to culture and sexuality, often thought of as ‘private’. This course will provide a historical and sociological perspective to how sexual governance – the control of women’s sexuality, conjugality and the definition of ‘marriage’ and the ‘family’ by a patriarchal state shows that the state has always concerned itself with the intimate lives of its citizens.</description>

  <description>The course introduces different understandings about categories of ‘environment’ and ‘environmentalism’ that have emerged in contemporary thought, and its implications to its study in within an ethics framework. It seeks to explore three tropes. First, is a foray into the nature-culture debate, a debate central to environmental ethics. It seeks to lay the basis for the field by tracing key texts in the debate, viz., how the category of ‘nature’ is understood to be something which is external to humans. Second, we seek to understand the ways in which the ‘crisis’ in environment is constructed, a crisis which then would require certain ethical approaches to amelioration of our relationship with our surroundings. Third, is an exploration of specific themes in the field of contemporary environmental ethics - critical environmental aesthetics, applied ethics in agriculture, and explore ethical frameworks from non Western realms like in the Indic context, and Buddhist environmental ethics. This course looks at the imperatives and politics that shaped the literatures and discourses that shaped environmental ethics as a distinct discipline.</description>

  <credit-structure>xamines in some detail the nature of the challenge that traditionally preoccupied European</<  description>writers - how to map the experience of the modern city, and what representational strategies were adequate for capturing the opacity, the fragmentation, and the transitory nature of urban modernity. It goes on to investigate the contemporary postcolonial city in order to understand it in relation to late capitalism, globalization, migration, and postmodern culture, and the challenges these pose to classic modernity. It begins by providing an introduction to some of the most important literature on the city and the major theoretical debates around it, offering students a set of conceptual tools with which to approach the city’s incommensurable realities, its problems and its potential. It moves on to a detailed analysis of a number of literary texts, examining some of the ways in which the disjunctive realities of city-life shape new modes of experience, creative expression, and solidarity, without losing sight of the inequities of gender, culture, class, and race that persist and indeed strengthen in the current global economic system.

  <description>The values inherent in The Traditional Knowledge Systems (TKS) viz., respect for all life and non-life, respect for diversity; awareness of social and ecological impact of activities; self-sufficiency; sustainability, socially appropriate, use of local natural and knowledge resources viz., decentralized, aesthetically pleasing, wealth distributive etc. It would be emphasized that these values are inherently present in the framework of traditional knowledge systems and are not add-ons. Traditional Technologies which are developed as part of the TKS framework are invented and tested in the field, where all environmental and social interaction, in particular its effect on other life-forms known and unknown are allowed to play their part. This non-fragmented approach makes such knowledge holistic and avoids the errors and pitfalls when technologies are applied on the basis of incomplete or inadequate theories.</description>

  <description>The course will begin with a brief theoretical understanding of policy making processes and touch upon the specifics of science and technology policy systems in India. It will specifically examine the role of stakeholders in the process such as grassroots voices and civil society organisations, industry, academia, international actors, and policy makers. It will then examine the role of science and technology in policies in selected current and emerging key sectors, e.g. transport, agriculture, health, energy, environment, or information and communication technologies. The course will also explore the inherently political and contested nature of decision making in the policy arena.</description>

  <name>Perspectives on Climate Change: Implications for Policy</name>
  <credits>3</credits>
  <credit-structure>3-0-0</credit-structure>
  <description>The course will develop a basic understanding of science of climate change, the associated uncertainties and the processes that link this science with policymaking. The impacts of climate change on socio-economic and natural systems and the link between climate change, and development policies will be discussed. The global distribution of greenhouse gas emissions and possible technological, market and regulatory trajectories to mitigate them will be discussed with the emphasis on how different trajectories lead to questions on geographic, inter-generational and distributional equity. The students would examine economic, political and institutional frameworks for understanding policies and practices designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, vulnerability to climate change and facilitate adaptation in the face of climate threats and explore how policy can produce or reduce vulnerability. The course will draw on theoretical framings and methodological tools from multiple disciplines including atmospheric sciences, economics, environmental policy, psychology and sociology.</description>
