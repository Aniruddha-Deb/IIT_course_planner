Narayan made their presence felt, before Salman Rushdie, and more quietly, Amitav Ghosh and Vikram Seth, erupted into the scene in the 1980s, spawning a generation of writers attaining international acclaim - Arundhati Roy, Aravind Adiga, Kiran Desai, and many others. Some of the questions that will be addressed are: Who constitutes the main audience for this writing, and (how) does the writing cater to it? How does one position the expatriate Indian writer both residing and publishing abroad? How does English become an Indian language? Is there a thematic congruence in the novels that fall under this category, and does it differ from the thematic concerns of novels written in other Indian languages? Students will be encouraged to read a novel in at least one other Indian language in order to allow them to pose these questions in a more pointed manner."

The course will consider some of these linguistic structures and communicative strategies in detail, beginning with early childhood development. How is it that children in every culture learn language so effortlessly despite its great complexity? The course aims to introduce students to a set of theories that address this and other puzzles and mysteries in the arena of language studies. Finally, since a central focus of the course is communication, it will strive to be as interactive as possible, with lots of scope for the discussion and working out of actual ‘problems’ in language use."

A range of socio- political thinkers, theories and concepts will be taught. It will provide a broad survey of fundamental social and political questions in current contexts discussing philosophical issues central to political thought and radical critiques of current political theories."

The structural and cultural dimensions of Indian society are explored at the level of village, city, region, nation and civilization. Sources of differentiation, diversity and unity are explored through institutions such as caste, class and tribe; kinship, family, marriage and gender systems, religious traditions and political organisations. Transformations in these institutions are analysed and fault lines explored by studying contemporary issues of secularism, communalism, religious conversions, caste and identity movements. The sociological perspective remains key to interpreting changes in Indian society in the era of globalization and rapid economic change."

The linkages between ancient theatre forms and existing forms of indigenous performance in various parts of India – such as the nautanki, the tamasha and the jatra. The energies which were generated in the urban centres through the encounter with European drama – the Parsi theatre, the nascent Marathi stage, the Hindi theatre of Bhartendu Harishchandra and the nationalist theatre of Calcutta – will be explored. Special attention would be paid to the transformation of theatre values with the intervention of the Indian People’s Theatre Association (IPTA). The focus for the post-Independence period would be on the diverse energies of urban theatre, group theatre and the ‘back to the roots’ movement. The course would require students to study play-scripts as well as look at accompanying literature to form a concrete idea of the philosophy behind Indian theatrical practice."

It will contrast this heterogeneous category with other kinds of writing such as the ‘functional’ writing found in text-books and reportage. Through an analysis of various techniques of writing - in master-texts as well as students’ own productions - the course will explore why and how literary texts continue to be a prime source of emotional and intellectual stimulation across cultures. As far as possible, the course will focus on contemporary writing, given that writers write in the ‘here and now’ even as they imagine the future or return to past memories. Selected readings will be used to focus students’ attention on that most difficult of problems: to acquire a style of writing that makes a writer’s ‘voice’ both unique and universal. Finally, students will be required to write in some genre(s) of their choice. These genres will include the classic areas of poetry, fiction and play-writing but will neither exclude non-fiction genres like the essay and biography nor forms of writing thrown up by the ‘new media’ such as blogs, photo-essays and narrative-writing for story- boards and video-games."

Life, in all aspects, everyday provides grist to the mill of satire, but does satire change anything? How do we define satire? Why is it considered the social genre? What are the contemporary forms of satire? Who can practice satire? It draws upon diverse techniques such as allegory, irony, caricature and laughter. Through analyses of examples, this course will familiarize students with satirical sub-genres and related literary practices, such as parody, burlesque, black humour, the grotesque, coarse humour, high and low comedy. It will examine the structure of satire, its relation with community, democracy and matters of gender, caste race, and religion."

In this course, the examination of sources, structure, texts and exemplars from Indian intellectual tradition provide a theoretical framework for the discussion of contemporary political and social issues. Economic development, social justice, religion and the nation, communalism and secularism, caste, class and gender equality are themes to be addressed. The political misuse of tradition in programs of reform and revival both in the past and in modern times will be highlighted to underline the need for rethinking Indian Philosophy and intellectual tradition in an academically rigorous manner. This course will also take into cognisance the intellectual history of the ancient past as it comes through the Vedic thought and its contestations."

Gender identities are not fixed or determined purely by physiology; their social construction affects ideas of masculinity and femininity or other sexual identities. Besides understanding how sex and gender are interrelated, we will look at how gender intertwines with societal areas of economy, technology, polity, religion and demography. The important role played by social structures and institutions such as caste, kinship, family, marriage, ethnicity, religion and class in structuring gender and vice-versa will be brought out. Technologies associated with population and biological sciences have transformed and are continuing to transform society and human relationships in particular directions. The course will examine these transformations at the global and local levels and consider their impact on individual lives. Challenges posed to intimate human relationships and identities by new reproductive technologies such as invitro-fertilization, surrogacy, sex selection will be explored. What does the emergence/ institutionalization of new social forms - such as same sex marriages and parenthood by surrogacy - tell us about the possibilities and limits of human relationships?"

This enables a shift from the managerial perspectives and psycho-social views of organisations, and draws out the complex negotiations and tensions endemic to organisational life.

Nor is it confined between 1780s and 1830s. Least is it a trend succeeded by Victorianism and realism, and assailed by modernism. Romanticism contends with the question of presentation – of representation of and to oneself. It therefore directly participates in the philosophical discussions of reason, sensibility, emotion, subjectivity, and most importantly the idea of human freedom. This course will familiarize students with romantic  movements in arts, in theories of language and society, in post- Kantian philosophy, in attitudes tor religion. Romantics not only engaged in experimental social practices and literary collaborations, but also articulated their necessity for the first time. Can we say that romanticism is at an end? How does it contribute to both a nationalism rooted in folk tradition, and individualism expressed in the cult of the hero, the solitary intellectual? How does it both look back to medieval occult and forward to novelties of science? Why is romanticism fascinated with animals, monsters and machines alike?"

As language is learnt from infancy, we begin by introducing two approaches to learning: top-down and  bottom-up. Further, we discuss language architectures that are both symbolic and non-symbolic in order to account for a fragment of English grammar: the past tense and nominalization. Following this, the course introduces some of the basic tools used by linguists in the analysis of language, while introducing concepts such as the syllable, morpheme, constituent structure etc. During lab sessions, students will work on problem sets to familiarize themselves with the analytical tools in linguistics.

Drawing on studies conducted on tamarin monkeys, ants, bees and zebra finches, we try to answer if the structure of the human mind is different from non-human minds, and if so, how. Are computational processes any less or more complex in the two sets of minds under consideration here? Some overarching themes running through the course are: (i) how does the nature-nurture debate play out in human and non-human linguistic systems, (ii) which parameters result from maturational processes that are innately specified, and which parameters are acquired by learning, (iii) whether the mental space is carved into modular compartments, where each module is an adaptive specialization to a particular problem or whether a non-modular mind serves as a general-purpose learning mechanism, (iv) what are the determinants of errors and (v) the constraints on imitation and production of language constructs when placed in contact or non-ideal situations."

How does it influence the everyday life-world, belief system, and identity of an individual or a community? And, what are the relationships between the sacred and secular or religion and modernity? Addressing these questions, this course examines the various concepts, theories and debates in the sociology/anthropology of religion. Contrary to the predictions of the secularisation hypothesis, which envisaged the decline or privatisation of religion with the spread of modernity and techno-scientific rationality, it is observed that there is a religious resurgence or de-secularisation of the world. Religion has assumed a more public role. Given this, the course will examine the implications of religion’s resurgence and active public role for modern democratic societies as well as the broader process of social order and social change."

It moves on to a detailed analysis of a number of literary texts, examining some of the ways in which the disjunctive realities of city-life shape new modes of experience, creative expression, and solidarity, without losing sight of the inequities of gender, culture, class, and race that persist and indeed strengthen in the current global economic system."

On finishing the course, students will be familiar with both theoretical (substantive) aspects of the minimalist architecture of grammar, as well the technical (methodological) know-how of the system."

While the correlation between the meaning and sounds of a word are arbitrary, the string of sounds or phonological shape of words and other morphological units follow certain universal well-formedness principles. While many of these principles derive from the manner in which individual languages form rhythmic/ prosodic domains in speech, some make crucial reference to morphological notions such as homonymy and synonymy. The aim of the course is to impart certain theoretical tools to analyze words from any natural language data. Since the objective of the course is to learn to analyze natural language data, it involves a substantial practical component."

The course will trace the development of narratological concepts (e.g. fabula/sujet, narrative voice, focalisation, paratext metalepsis, unreliability, free indirect speech, orientation, evaluation, coda etc.) within schools of thought since the 1970s on. It will visit the debates on narrativity and gender, race, history, ideology, culture and cognition. The spread of narrative theory beyond literary works to other areas such as comic books and video games, as well as its relevance to other disciplinary inquires in sociology, legal studies,  political theory, postcolonial theory and psychology will be discussed. The course will consider the philosophical questions of narrative and temporality, anti-narrative, subjectivity, language, action, personhood, framing, closure and evolutionary theory."

It will respond to questions about the nature of the pre- revolutionary moment emergent within existing historical situations and yet departing from them; the designation of selective historical moments as revolutionary; the variety of domains beyond the narrowly defined domain of politics that have seen revolution, for instance, in science, technology, social relations, and philosophy. With respect to political revolutions, how is a revolution in history analysed, and what happens to sovereignty? What is the role of violence in revolution as compared to other categories of history (period, epoch), and how does it affect language itself, both of literary representations of revolution and of historiography?"

It seeks to explore three tropes. First, is a foray into the nature-culture debate, a debate central to environmental ethics. It seeks to lay the basis for the field by tracing key texts in the debate, viz., how the category of ‘nature’ is understood to be something which is external to humans. Second, we seek to understand the ways in which the ‘crisis’ in environment is constructed, a crisis which then would require certain ethical approaches to amelioration of our relationship with our surroundings. Third, is an exploration of specific themes in the field of contemporary environmental ethics - critical environmental aesthetics, applied ethics in agriculture, and explore ethical frameworks from non Western realms like in the Indic context, and Buddhist environmental ethics. This course looks at the imperatives and politics that shaped the literatures and discourses that shaped environmental ethics as a distinct discipline."

It goes on to investigate the contemporary postcolonial city in order to understand it in relation to late capitalism, globalization, migration, and postmodern culture, and the challenges these pose to classic modernity. It begins by providing an introduction to some of the most important literature on the city and the major theoretical debates around it, offering students a set of conceptual tools with which to approach the city’s incommensurable realities, its problems and its potential. It moves on to a detailed analysis of a number of literary texts, examining some of the ways in which the disjunctive realities of city-life shape new modes of experience, creative expression, and solidarity, without losing sight of the inequities of gender, culture, class, and race that persist and indeed strengthen in the current global economic system."
