Narayan made their presence felt, before Salman Rushdie, and more quietly, Amitav Ghosh and Vikram Seth, erupted into the scene in the 1980s, spawning a generation of writers attaining international acclaim - Arundhati Roy, Aravind Adiga, Kiran Desai, and many others. Some of the questions that will be addressed are: Who constitutes the main audience for this writing, and (how) does the writing cater to it? How does one position the expatriate Indian writer both residing and publishing abroad? How does English become an Indian language? Is there a thematic congruence in the novels that fall under this category, and does it differ from the thematic concerns of novels written in other Indian languages? Students will be encouraged to read a novel in at least one other Indian language in order to allow them to pose these questions in a more pointed manner."

The course will consider some of these linguistic structures and communicative strategies in detail, beginning with early childhood development. How is it that children in every culture learn language so effortlessly despite its great complexity? The course aims to introduce students to a set of theories that address this and other puzzles and mysteries in the arena of language studies. Finally, since a central focus of the course is communication, it will strive to be as interactive as possible, with lots of scope for the discussion and working out of actual ‘problems’ in language use."

The structural and cultural dimensions of Indian society are explored at the level of village, city, region, nation and civilization. Sources of differentiation, diversity and unity are explored through institutions such as caste, class and tribe; kinship, family, marriage and gender systems, religious traditions and political organisations. Transformations in these institutions are analysed and fault lines explored by studying contemporary issues of secularism, communalism, religious conversions, caste and identity movements. The sociological perspective remains key to interpreting changes in Indian society in the era of globalization and rapid economic change."

As far as possible, the course will focus on contemporary writing, given that writers write in the ‘here and now’ even as they imagine the future or return to past memories. Selected readings will be used to focus students’ attention on that most difficult of problems: to acquire a style of writing that makes a writer’s ‘voice’ both unique and universal.

These genres will include the classic areas of poetry, fiction and play-writing but will neither exclude non-fiction genres like the essay and biography nor forms of writing thrown up by the ‘new media’ such as blogs, photo-essays and narrative-writing for story- boards and video-games."

Is modernity antithetical to tradition? The aim of this course is to take up these varied questions along with their nuances to understand and re-negotiate Indian intellectual traditions. In this course, the examination of sources, structure, texts and exemplars from Indian intellectual tradition provide a theoretical framework for the discussion of contemporary political and social issues. Economic development, social justice, religion and the nation, communalism and secularism, caste, class and gender equality are themes to be addressed. The political misuse of tradition in programs of reform and revival both in the past and in modern times will be highlighted to underline the need for rethinking Indian Philosophy and intellectual tradition in an academically rigorous manner. This course will also take into cognisance the intellectual history of the ancient past as it comes through the Vedic thought and its contestations."

Gender identities are not fixed or determined purely by physiology; their social construction affects ideas of masculinity and femininity or other sexual identities. Besides understanding how sex and gender are interrelated, we will look at how gender intertwines with societal areas of economy, technology, polity, religion and demography. The important role played by social structures and institutions such as caste, kinship, family, marriage, ethnicity, religion and class in structuring gender and vice-versa will be brought out. Technologies associated with population and biological sciences have transformed and are continuing to transform society and human relationships in particular directions. The course will examine these transformations at the global and local levels and consider their impact on individual lives. Challenges posed to intimate human relationships and identities by new reproductive technologies such as invitro-fertilization, surrogacy, sex selection will be explored. What does the emergence/ institutionalization of new social forms - such as same sex marriages and parenthood by surrogacy - tell us about the possibilities and limits of human relationships?"

While familiarising students with the theoretical approaches and concepts necessary to understand the individual as relationship to the organisation, it will enable students to think critically about questions of identity, agency, power and control in organisational spaces. We discuss the interface of culture, ways of thinking, feeling, acting and being in different organisations. This enables a shift from the managerial perspectives and psycho-social views of organisations, and draws out the complex negotiations and tensions endemic to organisational life. The course also draws on literature on different types of organisations such as hospitals, prisons and corporations to elaborate the unique cultural configurations in these spaces and contexts."

Nor is it confined between 1780s and 1830s. Least is it a trend succeeded by Victorianism and realism, and assailed by modernism. Romanticism contends with the question of presentation – of representation of and to oneself. It therefore directly participates in the philosophical discussions of reason, sensibility, emotion, subjectivity, and most importantly the idea of human freedom. This course will familiarize students with romantic  movements in arts, in theories of language and society, in post- Kantian philosophy, in attitudes tor religion. Romantics not only engaged in experimental social practices and literary collaborations, but also articulated their necessity for the first time. Can we say that romanticism is at an end? How does it contribute to both a nationalism rooted in folk tradition, and individualism expressed in the cult of the hero, the solitary intellectual? How does it both look back to medieval occult and forward to novelties of science? Why is romanticism fascinated with animals, monsters and machines alike?"

As language is learnt from infancy, we begin by introducing two approaches to learning: top-down and  bottom-up. Further, we discuss language architectures that are both symbolic and non-symbolic in order to account for a fragment of English grammar: the past tense and nominalization. Following this, the course introduces some of the basic tools used by linguists in the analysis of language, while introducing concepts such as the syllable, morpheme, constituent structure etc. During lab sessions, students will work on problem sets to familiarize themselves with the analytical tools in linguistics. They will get a chance to work on datasets in South Asian languages such as Malayalam and Hindi."

We then move on to discuss if the same property defines other communicative systems, including those of non-human primates, insects and birds. Drawing on studies conducted on tamarin monkeys, ants, bees and zebra finches, we try to answer if the structure of the human mind is different from non-human minds, and if so, how. Are computational processes any less or more complex in the two sets of minds under consideration here? Some overarching themes running through the course are: (i) how does the nature-nurture debate play out in human and non-human linguistic systems, (ii) which parameters result from maturational processes that are innately specified, and which parameters are acquired by learning, (iii) whether the mental space is carved into modular compartments, where each module is an adaptive specialization to a particular problem or whether a non-modular mind serves as a general-purpose learning mechanism, (iv) what are the determinants of errors and (v) the constraints on imitation and production of language constructs when placed in contact or non-ideal situations."

Contrary to the predictions of the secularisation hypothesis, which envisaged the decline or privatisation of religion with the spread of modernity and techno-scientific rationality, it is observed that there is a religious resurgence or de-secularisation of the world. Religion has assumed a more public role. Given this, the course will examine the implications of religion’s resurgence and active public role for modern democratic societies as well as the broader process of social order and social change."

It begins by providing an introduction to some of the most important literature on the city and the major theoretical debates around it, offering students a set of conceptual tools with which to approach the city’s incommensurable realities, its problems and its potential. It moves on to a detailed analysis of a number of literary texts, examining some of the ways in which the disjunctive realities of city-life shape new modes of experience, creative expression, and solidarity, without losing sight of the inequities of gender, culture, class, and race that persist and indeed strengthen in the current global economic system."

The epistemology of literature; Fictionality, Possible Worlds;Through what concept of existence do we distinguish literature from other phenomena, such as, hypotheses, lies, counterfactuals, dreams? Literature and/as Moral Philosophy; Is there a law of literature or does literature constitute legality itself? How does literature relate to non-literary, scientific, and everyday discourses? Life as Narrative and theories of narrative self; The relation between literature, aesthesis and reason; and emotional response to Fiction."

Ethnographic perspectives on the state seek to open up the state to critical scrutiny, dislodging it as a monolithic conceptual or territorial apparatus. These studies allow us to think of the state beyond governmentality or bureaucracy, to engaging with the multiple ways in which state ‘effects’ shape our engagement with it. How does the ‘idea’ of the state constrain the way in which we ‘think’ the state? What are the ethnographic sites through which the state emerges as an object of study, e.g., bureaucracy, law, sexuality, marriage, citizenship, borders etc? The course will consist of seminars designed around a set of readings, which will be discussed in detail each week."

Nationalism and patriotism are heavily grounded in issues pertaining to culture and sexuality, often thought of as ‘private’. This course will provide a historical and sociological perspective to how sexual governance – the control of women’s sexuality, conjugality and the definition of ‘marriage’ and the ‘family’ by a patriarchal state shows that the state has always concerned itself with the intimate lives of its citizens."

It seeks to explore three tropes. First, is a foray into the nature-culture debate, a debate central to environmental ethics. It seeks to lay the basis for the field by tracing key texts in the debate, viz., how the category of ‘nature’ is understood to be something which is external to humans. Second, we seek to understand the ways in which the ‘crisis’ in environment is constructed, a crisis which then would require certain ethical approaches to amelioration of our relationship with our surroundings. Third, is an exploration of specific themes in the field of contemporary environmental ethics - critical environmental aesthetics, applied ethics in agriculture, and explore ethical frameworks from non Western realms like in the Indic context, and Buddhist environmental ethics. This course looks at the imperatives and politics that shaped the literatures and discourses that shaped environmental ethics as a distinct discipline."

It goes on to investigate the contemporary postcolonial city in order to understand it in relation to late capitalism, globalization, migration, and postmodern culture, and the challenges these pose to classic modernity. It begins by providing an introduction to some of the most important literature on the city and the major theoretical debates around it, offering students a set of conceptual tools with which to approach the city’s incommensurable realities, its problems and its potential. It moves on to a detailed analysis of a number of literary texts, examining some of the ways in which the disjunctive realities of city-life shape new modes of experience, creative expression, and solidarity, without losing sight of the inequities of gender, culture, class, and race that persist and indeed strengthen in the current global economic system."

        "description": "1 Credit (0-0-2) students. The course will start with the introduction to a classical concert. A top-down approach will be applied to identify the components in a concert, namely, different types of compositions and fundamental elements. The elements of a composition including the raag (melody), swar (notes), laya (rhythm), taal (meter) and lyrics will be discussed. This will be further dissected to identify the notes and movements involved in a melody. The role of spontaneity and creativity in music and how these are systematically developed will be discussed. The differences between south and north Indian forms of music will be discussed. Discussion on other aspects and genres of music such as folk, regional, and popular music will also form part of the course. The course evaluation will be through both practical and written exams. Practical exam will be primarily listening based exams wherein their level understanding on various aspects such as raag, swar, laya, taal, lyrics, and different musical styles will be tested. Written exams will focus on the understanding of the fundamentals and theoretical aspects of music."

The impacts of climate change on socio-economic and natural systems and the link between climate change, and development policies will be discussed. The global distribution of greenhouse gas emissions and possible technological, market and regulatory trajectories to mitigate them will be discussed with the emphasis on how different trajectories lead to questions on geographic, inter-generational and distributional equity. The students would examine economic, political and institutional frameworks for understanding policies and practices designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, vulnerability to climate change and facilitate adaptation in the face of climate threats and explore how policy can produce or reduce vulnerability. The course will draw on theoretical framings and methodological tools from multiple disciplines including atmospheric sciences, economics, environmental policy, psychology and sociology."
